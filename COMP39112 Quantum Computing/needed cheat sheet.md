e^i theta = cos ... shit

e expansion

matrix det 2d

pauli maricies, and mult table, sigma and n vectors

adjoint?

identities - parralelogram, cauchy schwartz, triangle

change of basis for both vectors and matricies


definition of basis, linear independent, orthogonal, orthonormal

(rXn).n =  r.(nXn)
definition of cross product, dot product, norm vs absolute value, compelx conjugate real vs imaginary values

some trig rules maybe??? think you can remember them

maximal finite definition?

Q = c^2

hermitian, unitary defs

linear operator definition
