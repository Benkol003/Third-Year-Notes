Given your quantum state

- have some observation operator/ martix; hermitian - real-world values as eigenvalues. Each eigenvalue has a set of eigenvectors that form eigenvectors / eigenbasis / eigenspace

- Have a set of projections that project / collapse the wave function / quantum state into each observation - occurs randomly (probability amplitudes!)
- but for the observation made i.e. specific eigenvalue you have a projection  - projects into the eigenspace (i.e. qauntum state in terms of the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue observable) (TODO how is the projection matrix constructed?)
- There is information lost in the observation due to the projection matrix - a projection = $P^2=P$. For P to have an inverse $P^2=I$ therefore only have an inverse if projection is identity / null measurement - i.e. dont make an observation or change the quantum state.

discontinuous evolving 


- a quantum state can also evolve over time continuously  with unitary operator $U(t_0,t_1)$ -  timestep plancks constant - $U = E^{-tH}$ for hermitian operator and the hamiltonian of the system - time generator
