1920s-1950s; applied from 1940's upto 1970's until realised were too barbaric

- Electroconvulsive therapy - still used, for e.g. treating depression over antidepressants
- lobotomies - severing of neurons/connections in the frontal lobe
- deliberately administer  e.g. malaria for the treatment of *neurosyphilis* (Julius Wagner-Jauregg, nobel prize 1927) and other diseases


Very barbaric treatments

**Somatic treatments**: more concerned with the body, rather than mental treatment i.e. of the min d

developed in 'continental europe' (i.e. mainland europe)

More concerned with being 'medical' or 'scientific' i.e. of the body; specific cause e.g. anatomy abnormality, organ dysfunction, contagion illness, coupled with a specific scientific treatment, which 'cures' the treatment. However cure is rarely achieved, especially with mental disorders.

Why did psychatrists think their new treatments were effective?

**GPI** - general paralysis of the insane; (see week 4) - suspected in 19th century. In post-mortem brain would be soft and disintegrate. In 1860's was related to syphilis, and confirmed/accepted by 1890's.
microbe responsible for syphilis identified in 1905; drug treatment in 1908, **salvarsan**, however administered for long time + lots of side effects.

prestwich mental asylum, 1825? lots of post war patients 
shift from 'asylum' to renamed as 'mental hospitals', via 1930 mental treatment act

https://navigator.health.org.uk/theme/local-government-act-1929 poor law act? poor law hospitals / workhouse infirmaries https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_relief

more therapeutic that is optimistic, enthustistic, **boldness**  with radical treatments for e.g. cancer i.e. lots of treatments that would be ethically unacceptable today

psychiatry as a medical specialty i.e. a disciplin e in its own right

#### Mental illness

both mind and brain

anatomical structures of the brain? art more microscopic scales; looking at neuron connections;



- surgical approaches for mental health: excision, cutting connections; 'ablation' and regeneration of the brain to health - mystectomy (breast removal for breast cancer)
- physical - electroshock therapy
- chemical treatment with drugs
- biological - deliberate infection 


### neurosyphilis treatment with malaria

link between GPI and neurosyphilis
fever controlled with quinine - give malaria microbe-infected blood. Dangerous and expensive
was radical and broke 'therapeutic nihilism'.

- neurosyphilis - infection of central nervous system with syphilis bacteria

chemotherapy developed; 
penicillin as a more effective treatment for syphilis

treatment of psychosis with fever. lots of diseases
spirochetes


lancaster county asylum in collaboration with liverpool tropical school of medicine to research this malaria treatment?

mental illnesses treated much more like physical illnesses - less need for extensive psychotherapy i.e. need to go to the asylum.


However, this method (with malaria) was dubious  - only worked in a quarter of cases; also didnt work to treat other illnesses. However was a significant medical breakment?



### Insulin
First treatment of diabetes to not be a deadly disease; sitll practivced today

frederich banting, medical student charles best? - 1922; insulin extracted and administered to 14 year old in toronto, canada.
Insulin was extracted from pancreas.

### use in coma control
- initialled experimented low dose of insulin for morphine withdrawal in manfred sakel, psychriatric hosptial in berlin; however patient accidentaly slipped into coma, and awoke with observed with deliberate mental clarity. He proposed using insulin to force induce comas for treating illnesses (inducing convulsions) - insulin coma treatment. Used more routinely from 1940's to 1960's with specialised insulin coma treatment units. 
Mortality of 1 in 100 which is high; controlled by administering glucose; very intensive and required vigliance.




### leucotomy
(lobotomy in north america)
neurosurgery is not new - e.g. trephining to relieve pressure - still practiced.
developed by portugese physiatrist egas moniz - won nobel prize for this work.
IDea was to resolve fixations by cutting connections.
First drilled holes and then injected alcohol.

Thin end inserted through hole in skull and rotated using a Leucotome tool
orbitoclast? for transorbital leucotomy - walter freeman, james watts in america?


1940s,1950s as treatments of last resort in britain with particulary strong/unresolved mental health issues
david crossley - secondary resource: by 1954 more than 12,000 had leucotomies

liberated patients by relieveing cause of distress...


- was a therapy of last resort that worked when nothing else worked. Was a more radical intervention after other wekaer less successful.
- made patients manageable and able to be discharged.


- "taxeaters" to "taxpayers" - no longer to be creative e.g. write,compose, but then capable of waiting tables etc.

- new pharmacutical / drugs developed to make patients managable - apprently 'reversible' side effects
