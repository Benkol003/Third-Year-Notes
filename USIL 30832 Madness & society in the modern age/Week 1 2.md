The *york retreat* (opened 1796 with william tuke, intended for the quaker community) was revolutionary in taking a different approach; less use of custodial approaches & restraint e.g. chains; inmates encouraged to work and be rehabilitated / cured via proper treatment & a better doctor-patient relationship. Doctors were allowed to be in charge for a more scientific/medical approach. Thus this new wave of asylums was born by 1939.

Michael Foucault - Madness & civilisation:
However still remains to exercise power & control (upon patients) in a much more subtle manner to allow patients to control themselves.

1800's also saw the industrial revolution; new technologies; political revolutions - known as the age of reason, the birth of modernity & intellect. Industrial revolution led to urbanisation & increased consumerism which contributed to the growth of the asylum, but also argued by some that this led to an increase in societal madness.


1700s explanations of madness - medical, religious, supernatural, moral; approaches that would be deemed superstitious today.

Humoural pathology - long standing medical framework for 2000 years (terminology is still used). Health was determined by the balance of the 4 humours; otherwise would trigger a *constitution* in that direction.

Below diagram shows balanced & directed/unbalanced behaviours associated with the humours.

Balance may be restored by draining of a humour e.g. bloodletting, vomiting. These humours were associated via a connection of body & mind for treatments of madness. Abolished in the 19th century.

18th century saw diagnosis of madness, & association of the mind with the action of nerves & brain; increase in 'nervous disorders'. An idea of nerves being too relaxed/tense to cause disorders; still associated with the framework of purging of humours. Developing of cordials and tonics for treatment e.g. balm of gilead for the nervous system.

Theories of associating madness on the mind alone  - john locke (philosopher) (1690) - ideas of how the mind forms ideas; the mind starts as as a blank slate, all ideas are formed by sensory experiences, & madness caused by miss-association of ideas, or trauma to associate harmless ideas with harmful ones, causing a loss of reason & rationality, which seperates the human from the animal. This was used to justify harsh treatment of patients inhumanely / as animals - king george III beaten during his treatment of madness.

Madness having two directions of mania and melancholy as disease. A reversal of roles in modern day i.e. we see melancholy as a symptom of depression rather than the inverse causality.

Generally the 18th century seen as abysmally bad in terms of treatment of madness until its reform with the introduction of the york retreat.

Madness seen as a potential threat to social order, but the state/goverments concerned with those dangerous to society - i.e. taking people off the street & locking them up in madhouses:

Those without family care may 'hang around the village' or fall into the care of a charitable/religious organisation; Otherwise private for-profit madhouses for patients under family care

### Reform in the early 19th century
Issues with wrongful treatment, issues with a for-profit system, moral treatment  concerns stemmed from the york retreat, proper patients are only put into care (issues of wrongful confinement by *alienists*) (e.g. not locked up by hateful family members).

#### Bethlam scandal
James norris - chained isolation for 10 years, yet found rational by the 1815? select commitee & freed from wrongful confinement - died shortly after causing public outcry and further reform. In the future we will see scandals as a driving force for reform.
