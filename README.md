Third Year Module Notes.

Notes have been formatted to try appear properly in GitHub markdown preview; However some math notation e.g. matrices don't render properly, & you will see the full MathJax notation instead.
This can be rendered properly if you view it locally, e.g. with obsidian or vs code.
