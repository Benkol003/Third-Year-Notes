Notes for:
- UoM Computer science third year modules
- General Programming notes

PDF's for academic papers that aren't easily accessible from open-access i.e. arXiv are included. (Paywalls for academic journals can fuck right off!)

Notes have been formatted to try appear properly in GitHub markdown preview; However some math notation e.g. matrices don't render properly, & you will see the full MathJax.
(This isn't my fault, GitHub markdown preview is broken.)
This can be rendered properly if you view it locally, e.g. with obsidian or vs code.
