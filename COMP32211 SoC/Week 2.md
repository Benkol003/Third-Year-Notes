### Simulation

We are already provided with a high-level model. Implementation and timing is not exact. 

We will be performing:
- functional verification of RTL/verilog descriptions. This is aided by testing and test coverage.
- Timing - do internal circuits adhere to the timing cycle given it's critical path? This is aided by using simulation.
