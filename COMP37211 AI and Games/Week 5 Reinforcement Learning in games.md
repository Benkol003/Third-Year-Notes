When to use machine learning over search algorithms like minimax:
- When we have a very large game tree to search
- We can't come up with a good evaluation function
- Hard to find Nash equilibrium - in:
	- Games of imperfect information
	- General Sum games
	- Games with large no. of players

Machine learning is preferred for games such as poker, chess, go...

### Reenforcement Learning
We use the outcome of the game to provide training feedback to our ML model.
