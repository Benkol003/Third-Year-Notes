- Gradient descent algorithm:

notes don't make clear - can we not guarantee convergence if the function isn't lipshitz-smooth? or is it just more favorable?


gradient descent can still converge even if the function is not convex or lipshitz-smooth.

(look in the notes at this proof, go through it yourself)

from this point the maths gets too involved, look at the notes
